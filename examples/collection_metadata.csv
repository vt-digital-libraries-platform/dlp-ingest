Born and educated in Bulgaria, Laleyan arrived in the United States in 1964. Laleyan practiced architecture in Sofia, Bulgaria; Paris, France; and the United States. Before establishing her own practice she worked with the firms Hart & Turner Architects (Sacramento, California); Richard Neutra (Los Angeles, California); and the San Francisco, California, firms of Claude Oakland and Associates; Anshen & Allen; Mario J.

An active member of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), she served on the Northern California Chapter's Board of Directors, co-chaired the national AIA Task Force on Women in Architecture, and coauthored the AIA Affirmative Action Plan. She was also a founder of the Bay Area's Organization of Women in Architecture (OWA) and represented the interests of women architects at numerous conferences and seminars.

The establishment of Laleyan Associates in 1977 was the culmination of a lifelong career intention and in her words a “family tradition.” Laleyan was committed to keeping the firm small so that she would be able to provide quality service and personal attention to each project and client. Projects undertaken by Laleyan Architects included light commercial, medical, institutional, residential, and public buildings with construction costs ranging from 25,000-3.4 million dollars.

Pettersen received a Certificate in Architecture from Cooper Union for Advancement of Science and Art in 1941 and was an apprentice to Frank Lloyd Wright at Taliesin from 1941-1943. She was licensed as an architect in the state of New Jersey in 1950, making her one of the first women to receive this licensure. She was the first woman in New Jersey to open her own architectural office. She primarily designed residences and was also very active in professional and civic organizations. She became a Fellow of the American Institute of Architects (FAIA) in 1991. 

Over the years she employed a number of interns and apprentices (often women), preferring to hire right out of architecture school. Within a few weeks of being hired and initiated into the firm’s detail-oriented method, the new employees were assigned their own projects and were encouraged to work closely with the clients and to follow their projects through not only the design, but the building aspects as well. In July 1970, Pettersen formed Design Collaborative, an interior design component to her architectural firm, furthering her thorough involvement in the design process.

Although Pettersen designed a number of commercial and institutional properties, she was primarily a residential architect. Among her clients were former President Richard Nixon and jazz artist George Benson. She was also extremely proud of her involvement with the luxury town house community, Bear’s Nest, in Park Ridge, New Jersey. It was developed in phases during the 1980s and 1990s, and each of the approximately 200 units had custom design features.

Pettersen’s commitment to the architectural profession superseded creating designs and working with clients. She also served on a number of national and local professional and civic organizations promoting architecture as a viable profession for women. Professionally she was just as engaged, becoming a member of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) in 1954 and serving on various sub-committees. She also belonged to the New Jersey Society of Architects, the Architectural League of Northern New Jersey, and served on the boards of local architecture schools like the New Jersey Institute of Technology. 

During her fifty year career Pettersen achieved a number of firsts including becoming the first woman recipient of the Professional Achievement Citation for Distinguished Accomplishments by Cooper Union (1965); the first woman appointed by the governor to the New Jersey State Board of Architects and subsequently its first woman president (1975- 1976); the first female president of the New Jersey Society of Architects (1984); and the first woman elected as New Jersey’s Regional Director to the AIA Board (1986-1989).
