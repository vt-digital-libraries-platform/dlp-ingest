The real problem in postmarking mail, however, was keeping pace with the ever-growing number of letters and cards which had to be processed.
In order to save both time and labor, the first canceling machine to receive serious consideration was invented by Thomas and Martin Leavitt of Boston and patented in 1876. In 1882, Leavitt's machine No.? was adopted by Congress to be used in large city post offices. Early models were operated by turning a hand crank. Later models were belt-driven.
It was estimated that an experienced clerk could face and hand stamp 1500 to 2000 letters per hour. Whereas the No.? machine had a rated capacity of 15,000 pieces per hour. In 1892, satisfactory machines were developed to operate on electric power.
In 1902, the Roanoke Post Office installed a new canceling machine that operated by an electric motor. It had an operating capacity of 380 letters per minute.
Around 1917—18, the canceling machine on display was placed in service at the Floyd Post Office and remained in use until 1936. It was replaced by a more modern and efficient machine that had the hand crank placed on the right side. This machine remained in service until approximately 2000 when outgoing mail was sent to a regional processing center for postmarking.",,,,,mail|| Cancelling Machine,Postal service|| Postal service--Equipment and supplies|| Canceling machines,"Donor, Unknown","Floyd County Historical Society (Floyd County, Va.)",https://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC-NC/1.0/?language=en,1

(In my book and in the picture book done by historical society, there's a picture of my Grandpa Turner's store on the Franklin Pike.) Years before, though, my grandparents lived nearby on Paradise Lane and they were living there when Grandpa brought home the zither as a Christmas gift. I don't recall ever hearing anyone play this instrument.
I came to have it from my mother and her Turner side of family. I think there may have at one time been a few pieces of sheet music - notes that could be slid under the strings.
